# Controller in Web Applications

A **controller** in a web application is a key part of the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture. It acts as the brain of the application, managing how data flows between the client and the database.

## **Role of a Controller**

A controller is responsible for:

- **Handling incoming HTTP requests**  
  It manages requests such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.

- **Interacting with the database or models**  
  It fetches, saves, updates, or deletes data as needed.

- **Sending responses back to the client**  
  It ensures the client receives the appropriate response, like JSON data, HTML pages, or redirects.

## ** Summary**

A controller **processes requests** from the client, decides what to do with the data, and sends the right response back. It connects the **routes** with the **models** and keeps the application logic organized.
